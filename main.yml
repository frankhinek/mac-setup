# This is necessary due to the way the Ansible setup process inherits
# variables from the play.  The system path is prepended with /usr/local/bin
# below to ensure the system on which the playbook is run selects the correct
# copy of zsh, etc.  In other words, to make sure it uses /usr/local/bin/zsh
# installed with Homebrew and not the older macOS /bin/zsh.
